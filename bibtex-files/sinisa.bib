	abstract = {This paper proposes an extension to CERIF compatible CRIS, enabling automated evaluation of research achievements by applying diverse (country/region/institution specific), or even multiple evaluation rulebooks and guidelines. It was implemented as an extension to the CERIF compliant CRIS system of the University of Novi Sad (CRIS UNS) that already contains information for assessment of results from scientific journals, so the focus of this research is an extension to the CERIF model aimed at evaluation of the results published through conferences. Based on a survey and an analysis of selected evaluation rulebooks and guidelines, the paper proposes an extended CERIF model that comprises conference evaluation related metadata and a machinereadable representation of a rulebook that enables automated evaluation. A rule-based expert system is proposed for representation of evaluation rules and evaluation of research results. The Serbian rulebook is represented and implemented using the expert system Jess in order to evaluate the proposed model. Reliance of the model on CERIF standard allows its easy application in any CERIF compatible CRIS system.},
